Most .sas7bdat files came from https://github.com/BioStatMatt/sas7bdat but some came from https://github.com/hadley/haven and hopefully others will be added too.

CSV files were converted from sas7bdat by StatTransfer13.

The files in sasbdat-partial work mostly but do not exactly match the output of StatTransfer13.

The files in sas7bdat-unsupported don't work at all. Maybe they are just corrupt, I'm not sure.
